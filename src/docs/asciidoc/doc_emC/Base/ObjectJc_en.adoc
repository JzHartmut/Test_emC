[#ObjectJc]
== What is ObjectJc

The struct `ObjectJc` is a basic struct that can be used for all data instances 
(`struct` and `class`) with some common maybe important information with less effort. 

To use `ObjectJc` the application should

#include <applstdef_emC.h>
#include <emC/Base/ObjectJc>

Depending on the compiler switches in link:applstdef_emC_h.html[]

----
include::../../../../main/cpp/src_emC/emC_inclApplSpec/stdef_ApplCpp64/applstdef_emC.h[tag=ObjectJc]
----

different approaches for `ObjectJc` are possible. 

[#ObjectNO]
=== Not Using ObjectJc

If `DEF_NO_ObjectJc_emC` is defined, you don't need any `emC/Base/Object*.*` in your sources.
It means it is for startup. 

The `struct ObjectJc` is nevertheless defined in `emC/Base/applstded_default.h`:
----
typedef struct  ObjectJc_T { int id; } ObjectJc;
----

as well as

----
typedef struct  ClassJc_T { int id; } ClassJc;
----

Because this types are used, it is not possible to prevent it. 
But the content is reduced to only one integer value, which is also usable
for a proper identification number. That should not be a disadvantage. 

For experience with less code you can define in your `applstdef.h`:

----
#define BASED_ON_ObjectJc_emC
----

Left empty this define. Then some sources can be used (not all) without this base structure. 

All relevant macros which are used in all sources of emC are properly defined,
usual empty. 
Hence all sources of emC are able to compiler.
Only the ObjectJc-relevant functionality is not given. 
This is regarded in tests, see especially `Test_emC/src/test/cpp/emC_Test_ObjectJc/*`


[#ObjectSimple]
=== Using ObjectSimple_emC.h

If the compiler switch 

 #define DEF_ObjectSimple_emC
 
is set, the `emC/Base/ObjectSimple_emC.h` defines the `ObjectJc` class:

* either as simplest if `DEF_REFLECTION_NO` is defined:

 typedef struct  ObjectJc_T
 { uint32 identSize;
 } ObjectJc;
 
* or if `DEF_REFLECTION_NO` is not set, including a reference to a type information `ClassJc`: 

 typedef struct  ObjectJc_T
 { uint32 identSize;
   struct ClassJc_t const* reflection;
 } ObjectJc;

The simplest form contains in only 32 bit:

* An identifier for the type, important for type check on downcast.
* Information about initialized status: init or run, one bit. An instance should be
switched to the run mode if all aggregations are complete.
* Information whether it is an head of an array
* A lock bit. This lock information can be used for example for a polling of the lock state in an interrupt. 
* Size information.

For these pieces of information only 4 Byte (an `uint32_t`) is necessary;

 //in src_emC/emC/Base/ObjectSimple_emC.h:
 typedef struct  ObjectJc_T
 {
  /**The identSize is helpfull to recognize the instance. 
   * The bit31 is used to detect whether it is initialized or not. */
  uint32 identSize;
  #define mInitialized_ObjectJc  0x80000000
  #define mArray_ObjectJc        0x40000000
  #define mLocked_ObjectJc       0x20000000
  #define mInstanceType_ObjectJc 0x1fff0000  
  #define kBitInstanceType_ObjectJc 16
  #define mSize_ObjectJc         0x0000ffff

For this basic features the type identification has 13 bits, which can distinguish between 8191 types qualified by a number. With this information RTTI (Run Time Type Information) for a qualified checked `dynamic cast<...>` may be unnecessary, a normal cast can be done with the user programmed simple type check, for example for data variants. Note that casts may be a source of programming errors and/or unreliability. A check is usual a good decision. The disadvantage, definition of the type-identification number in the users sources, can be seen as advantage, because the numbers can be synchronized over more applications in a project. 

The possible additonally reflection information, also available for the `ObjectSimple_emC.h` usage, offer more possibilities (allow check also of a base class, also possible to use for {cpp} derivation), and it enables using the 13 Bits instead for the type for an instance identification. Hence the mask `mInstance_ObjectJc` is given: 

  #ifndef DEF_REFLECTION_NO
    #define mInstance_ObjectJc   0x1fff0000
    #define kBitInstance_ObjectJc 16
    /**The reference to the type information. */
    struct ClassJc_t const* reflection;
  #endif
} ObjectJc;

The here shown `ClassJc` doesn't contain information about fields, for the simple variant, only the type but basic types too. See also link:ClassJc_en.html[] 

----
typedef struct ClassJc_t
{
  /**Index of the class in the reflectionOffsetArrays array if DEF_REFLECTION_OFFS is used,
   * elsewhere a simple Type ID. It may be used to compare types in different executables
   * (via connections). */
  uint32 idType;

  #ifndef DEF_NO_StringUSAGE
    char const* name;
  #endif

  #ifdef DEF_REFLECTION_OFFS
    /**Refers the table with offset and type of the elements of this class. */
    int32 const* reflOffs;
  #endif
  struct ClassJc_t const* superClass;
} ClassJc;
----

The `ClassJc` contains a textual name, it is proper for debugging. For small embedded systems with less memory all textual information can be prevented. For test of this software on PC or usage in a larger target hardware it can be present. 

[#ObjectRefl]
=== Using ObjectRefl_emC.h

The file `ObjectRefl_emC.h` offers a more complex system: 

The struct ObjectJc is defined alternatively, with fine gradual bit usage for the size. The size for some instances can be more as 64k:

* 4095 instances(0x0fff) with < = 64 kByte, 
* 255 instances (0x0ff0) with < = 1 MByte,
* 31 instances  (0x1F00) with < = 16 MByte

This are the bit ranges with a designation inside the `identSize` variable:  

 #define mSizeBits_ObjectJc     0x30000000
 #define kIsSmallSize_ObjectJc  0x00000000
 #define kIsMediumSize_ObjectJc 0x10000000
 #define mIsLargeSize_ObjectJc  0x20000000

available if in the `applstdef_emC.h` is set:

 #define DEF_ObjectJc_LARGESIZE
 
Furthermore:

* The `ClassJc` is defined with complete reflection information, especially fields (elements) of a `struct` or `class`.
* Possibility to manage Mutex and Notify Objects for Multithreading operations (similar as in Java for `java.lang.Object`: `synchronized` and `wait` / `notify`) - it is only an ident numer for the Mutex and Notify Instance managed in the RTOS adaption.   
* Offset for Reflection- und ObjectJc-usage in {cpp}
* Address of the instance (necessary for memory images, association of data)
* Some support for a `BlockHeap` concept

  
For usage of `ObjectJc` in a {cpp} context with symbolic information about fields
in the derived class an additional offset between start of the data class
and position of the `ObjectJc` inside the data are necessary. Additionally a field
for handle values is intended here. This both fields are available if the following
compiler switch is set:

  #ifdef DEF_ObjectJcpp_REFLECTION
    /**Offset from the data-instance start address to the ObjectJc part. 
     * It is especially for symbolic field access (reflection) in {cpp}. */
    uint16 offsetToStartAddr;
    /**Some handle bits to use an ObjectJc for lock (mutex). */
    uint16 handleBits;
    #define kNoSyncHandles_ObjectJc 0x0fff;
  #endif

In this case, but also independently if not `DEF_REFLECTION_NO` is defined,
a reference from `ObjectJc` to `ClassJc` named `reflection` is available, as also in the simple form of ObjectJc.
This improves the type test capability, especially recognizing base type references 
(derivation), and it opens the possibility to support full symbolic information 
about the fields in the data. It is the 'reflection' capability, see link:ClassJc_en.html[].  

  #ifndef DEF_REFLECTION_NO
    ....
    #define mInstance_ObjectJc   0x3fff0000
    ....
    /**The reference to the type information. */
    struct ClassJc_t const* reflection;
  #endif

If a `ClassJc` instance can be referenced, the identifier in the first word 
`identSize` is now used as  instance identifier. 

Last not least the own address of the Object can be stored in the ObjectJc.
The address of itself can be used if data are copied to any file (a memory map), 
and references between the data should be readjusted. 

  #ifdef DEF_ObjectJc_OWNADDRESS
    void const* ownAddress;
  #endif
 } ObjectJc;

Depending on the memory layout the reflection and the ownAddress has 2 Byte 
(in 16-bit-Systems), 4 Byte or 8 Byte (for 64-bit-Adressing). In all cases the alignment
is correct. Note that 64-bit-addresses should aligned to a memory word boundary wich is usually 8 Byte.

The idea for `ObjectJc` came from Java. In Java all instances have a base ('_super_')
class `java.lang.Object` with adequate information. It is a proven concept.

[#ObjectJc_C]
== Using ObjectJc for C struct

The usage of `ObjectJc` is independent of its definition (Simple, with Refl, Jc). The capability is different of course but the sources are indentically.

A C struct for C and {cpp} compilation should be defined as:

 typedef struct MyData_T {
   union { MyBaseData super; ObjectJc obj; } base;
   int32_t anyData;
 } MyData_s;
 
* The usage of `typedef` is recommended. Some compilers expect it, it is the clarified form.

* The `MyData_T` is the tag name. The tag name should not be the same as the type name, 
some compilers may have problems elsewhere! It can be used for forward-declaration.

 struct MyData_T;
 ....
 extern struct MyData_T anyData; //data are only declared
 .....
 struct MyData_T* ref = getRef(...)  //only use the reference without access
 
* The type name `MyData_s` is written with suffix `_s` to offer the possibility
for a wrapping {cpp} class which should be named `MyData`. 
This writing rules are regarded by link:ClassJc_en.html#Header2Refl[ClassJc_en, chapter "The reflection generator"].

The `ObjectJc` is arranged as the last or only one element inside a union. The other parts
of the union should be base `struct` (super `struct`), 
whereby the immediate super `struct` should be arranged first, necessary for
`INIZ_...` initialization with `{ ... }`. 
This writing rule enables the access to `ObjectJc` in an unified form independent
of super `struct` nesting (inheritance in C) writing:

 ObjectJc* obj = &myDataRef->base.obj;
 
For C usage it is the same as a simple pointer casting `((ObjectJc*)myDataRef)`
because the ObjectJc is the first part in memory. 
But usage pointer castings is not recommended because it is an additional 
(supposed unsafe) cast. Secondly it may be faulty if `myDataRef` is a {cpp} class
where the `ObjectJc` is member of. 
Unnecessary casting is an example of dirty software which runs
some years, then somebody extends it, and the assumption for the cast is no longer true.
Hence an important rule for C-programming is: "*Avoid unchecked casting of pointers!*". 


[#Cpp]
== Using ObjectJc in {cpp} classes

It is possible and may be recommended for state variables which may be exported (serialized) to define the data of a {cpp} class as C-`struct`. 
Then this `struct` contains `ObjectJc` in the form above.   

There are generally three forms to inherit from a C-`struct`:

 class MyData: public MyData_s { ... 

with possible access to data and immediately to `myDatab->base.obj`.

 class MyData: proctected MyData_s { 
   ... 
   public: ObjectJc const* toObject() {
     return this->base.obj; 
   }
   
It has protected access to the data, but a individual operation `toObject()` 
which returns the `ObjectJc const*` reference only to the read only `ObjectJc` data.
This form does not need virtual operations for that.

 class MyData: public ObjectJcpp, proctected MyData_s { 
   ... 
   public: ObjectJc const* toObject() {
     return this->base.obj; 
   }

The interface `ObjectJcpp` contains the operation `toObject()` as virtual, 
hence a reference of type `ObjectJcpp` is generally useable to access the `ObjectJc` data. 
But this form needs virtual operations, it may not be desired in some embedded applications.

It is a question of {cpp} using philosophy: 

* If {cpp} should be used only because of some {cpp} language features, for example
operator definition (`float operator+(...)`),
but virtual operations are forbidden by style guide for safety than
the first or second form is appropriate.

* For common {cpp} usage the third form is recommended.


See test sources, it contains some casting situations too: 
`emC_Base/src/test/cpp/emC_Test_ObjectJc/test_ObjectJcpp.cpp`.

[#initC]
== Initializing of data with ObjectJc

[#INIZ]
=== static and const initializing with initializer list in C

To get const data in a const memory section (Flash Rom) only
a `const` initializing can be done with an so named _initializer list_.
Thas is the same situation in C as in {cpp} (!). 

 Type const myData = { ..... };  //hint: write const right side.
 const Type myData = { ..... };  //it is the same
 
In C it is not possible to initialize const data in any operations in runtime, 
other than in {cpp}. The immediately initializing C-style is necessary 
if data should be stored in a const memory section (on Flash-ROM, for embedded Processors). 
This topic is irrelevant for {cpp} programming on a PC platform, 

For non `const` data the same initializing with an _initializer list_
is possible for all non-allocated data (not from heap). 
If static data are used an initializing  may be seen as recommended.

 Type myData;  //The initial data are undefined - prone of error
 Type myData = {0}; //at least forced 0-initialization.
 
An _initializer list_ with given data is often complex to write, it is a challenge for the programmer. Macros to initialize some parts of nested data are helpful.

For example some `struct` may be defined as:

 typedef struct BaseType_T {
   union{ ObjectJc obj;} base;
   int32 data1;
   float data2;
 } Base_Type;
 //
 typedef struct InnerData_T {
   float x,y,z; 
 } InnerData;
 //
 typedef struct MyType_T {
   union { BaseType BaseType; ObjectJc obj; } base;
   int32 m, n;
   InnerData data1;
   int p,q;
 } MyType_s;

then a initializer is complex. 
Especially if some types are defined in another module or component it is difficult to handle. 
At least for ObjectJc a macro `INIZ_ObjectJc` can be used. 
It is recommended to write such an `INIZ...` macro for any type:

 #define INIZ_VAL_BaseType( OBJ, REFL, ID, VAL) \
  { { INIZ_ObjectJc(OBJ, REFL, ID) } \
  , (int32)VAL, (float)VAL \
  }

 #define INIZ_InnerData( ) \
  { 3.14f, 42.0f, -3.0f }  //it is only a const initizalization

 #define INIZ_VAL_MyType( OBJ, ID, VAL1, VAL2) \
 { { INIZ_VAL_MyBaseType(OBJ, refl_MyType, ID, VAL1) } \
 , VAL2, -(VAL2) \
 , INIZ_InnerData() \
 , 0,0 \
 }

This macros should be written near to the struct definitions, to see the association. 

* The arguments of the macro may have a free meaning and order 
But the initializing values have to be able to calculate on compile time.
* Because the `BaseType` has `base.obj`, it uses the `INIZ_ObjectJc(...)`.
* Because the `BaseType` is used as base type, it is necessary to give 
the reflection information as argument `REFL` here.
* The `INIZ_VAL_MyType(...)` does not need information about the data arrangement 
of the inner struct data. It invokes only the `INIZ...` macro of the nested data.
Hence the information about the data arrangement is encapsulated.

* The first `INIZ...` macro inside `INIZ_VAL_MyType(...)` should have a `REFL`-argument. 
Because the `MyType` is never used as base class the reflection are not given as
argument, but they are given immediately. 

The `INIZ_ObjectJc` macro is defined depending on the variants of `ObjectJc` 
in different forms. The arguments are the same in any case. 
As special feature the `REFL` argument is used in case of `DEF_ObjectJc_SIMPLE` as 

 #define INIZ_ObjectJc(OBJ, REFL, ID)  \
 { ((((uint32)(ID_##REFL))<<kBitInstanceType_ObjectJc) & mInstanceType_ObjectJc) \
 | (sizeof(OBJ) & mSize_ObjectJc) \
 }

It means, the identifier for the reflection class is used as identifier 
for the numerical `ID_refl_MyType` because the simple variant of an `ObjectJc` 
has not a reference to the reflection but only the ID. The definition of an

 ClassJc const refl_MyType = INIZ_ClassJc(refl_MyType, "MyType");
 
it not necessary and may not be given if `DEF_REFLECTION_NO` is set. The type-ID 
already stored in a also given `ClassJc const` cannot be used for a const initialization
because it is not able to calculate on compile time:

Getting a `const` value from a given another `const` instance inside an 
initializer list is not possible in C 
and not possible for C++ `const`-memory-segment-initialization. 
The access to `refl->idType` fails though it is a instance defined before. 
It is too complex for the compiler's initializer value calculation.

Adequate it is not possible to use the address of the instance shifted and masked
for the correct bit position. An address value inside a constant initializer list
is only possible by linker replacement, the address value can only be set 
as const reference as a whole from the linker. Some numeric calculations afterwards
cannot be done with it because they would need to be done by the compiler.


[#CTOR]
=== CTOR_/ctor_ObjectJc(...) - initialization on run time 

The `ObjectJc` part on an instance is the core part but it contains information
for the whole instance: The type and size. Hence it should be initialized firstly
with respect to the instance:

 MyType_s data;
 CTOR_ObjectJc( &data.base.obj, &data, sizeof(data)
              , refl_MyType, ID_Obj);

It uses the first argument as argument to the `ObjectJc` part inside the data, and the second argument as `void*` instance pointer. This is necessary for {cpp} usage in derived classes, where `ObjectJc` is not on top of the data.

Then the construction of the instance can be done:

 ctor_MyType(&data, 42.0f, 234);

The `CTOR_ObjectJc` is a macro which regards `DEF_REFLECTION_NO`. In this case 
it uses the given identifier for the reflection type and invokes

 ctor_ObjectJc(&data.base.obj, &data, sizeof(data), null, ID_refl_MyType);

It does not assume the existence of a `ClassJc` instance. But the `ID_refl...` should be defined, see link:ClassJc_en.html#ID_refl[]. But if a `ClassJc` instance is given anyway,
the 

 ctor_ObjectJc(&data.base.obj, &data, sizeof(data), refl_MyType, ID_Obj);

can be used. In case of `DEF_ObjectJc_SIMPLE` the type-ID is taken from the `ClassJc` 
instance and the `ID_Obj` is not use. 

The constructor of the user types should not invoke the `ctor_ObjectJc(...)`.
Instead a check of consistence can be done, which assures that the given instance
has a proper size and the given type is matching. This can be done as assertion:

 ASSERT_emC( CHECKstrict_ObjectJc( &thiz->base.obj, sizeof(*thiz)
                                 , refl_MyType, 0)
           , "not matching instance and type", 0,0);

It has the advantage that the check-code is not existing if `ASSERT_IGNORE_emC` is set.
On embedded platforms usually the construction is done only on startup. The startup can
be tested well on PC platform with assertion check and with Exception handling, 
so errors are detected on PC-test. 

The `CHECKstrict_ObjectJc(...)` is a macro again which invokes in case of `DEF_REFLECTION_NO`:

 checkStrict_ObjectJc(OTHIZ, SIZE, null, ID_##REFL)
 
It does only test, an Exception is thrown only in conclusion with `ASSERT_emC`.

'''

Some details to the arguments both for ctor_... and CTOR_...

* `REFL` For the reflection argument (See link:#refl[chapter "Reflection and Types"]). 

* `ADDR` The second argument of the ctor `ADDR` is expected of type `void*` and should be the address 
of the instance itself. It has the same value for C-compilation as the `ObjectJc` reference
because `ObjectJc` is the first element in a `struct`.
But for {cpp} there may be small differences between the address of the instance 
and the `ObjectJc` data part. 
This is if inheritance and virtual tables are used. 
The difference between both address values are stored in the `ObjectJc::offsetToInstanceAddr`, 
which requires setting `DEF_ObjectJcpp_REFLECTION`. If it is not set but 
`DEF_REFLECTION_FULL` is set, and {cpp} compiling is used, then an compiler error message 
is forced (`#error ...`).
The `offsetToInstanceAddr` is necessary to access
data via reflection (`FieldJc`). Hence in {cpp} this form of initializing should be used.
The initializer list is not suitable for use. 

* `SIZE`: The `ObjectJc` part stores the size of the whole instance. Hence it can be tested only with knwoledge of the `ObjectJc` reference whether a safe access to memory is possible with a given reference. Faulty pointer castings can be detected on runtime. It is important that the memory bounds are resepected. Data error because of software errors are acceptable (can be still found), but memory violations causes dubios behavior and ard hard to debug. 

* `ID` The last argument `ID` of the `CTOR_ObjectJc`-Macro is not used in case of `DEF_ObjectJc_SIMPLE`
because the type-ID is stored in the only one `identSize` element. 
But if the `ID` contains the `mArrayId_ObjectJc` flag bit, it is set in the `ObjectJc`. 
It is necessary for the `ObjectArrayJc` which contains the reflection reference to the elements, not for the whole instance. Note that the size information in the `ObjectJc` part is for the whole array, it is always for the whole instance.  

[#CppObjectJc]
=== Initializing for {cpp}

In {cpp} allocation and construction are combined. It is true in both kinds of creation:

 MyData* data = new MyData(...);
 MyData data(...);  //ctor is invoked with data definition
 
That is a consequent {cpp} feature and prevents errors because of non-initialized data.

The concept of the `ObjectJc` as core part which contains information 
about the whole instance seems to be primary not regarded. 
Some special constructs and style guides are necessary:

 typedef struct MyPlainData_T {                  //Data in C manner, plain
  union { ObjectJc obj; } base;             //with ObjectJc as core
  int32 d1; //:Any data
  float d2;  //Note: padding any struct to 8-Byte-align if possible, 
 } MyPlainData_s;

 class MyBaseClass: protected MyPlainData_s      //contains ObjectJc as core
 {
   public: MyBaseClass(int idObj);
   public: MyBaseClass(ObjectJc const* othis = null);
 }
 
 class MyClass: protected MyBaseClass      //contains ObjectJc as core too
 { 
   public: MyClass(int idObj);
   protected: MyClass(ObjectJc const* objectJc);
 }

The ObjectJc should contain the size of all data, but only of the plain data, 
except organization data of C++ (vtable pointer). It should be initialized firstly,
because the ctor of C data parts may check the size and type. 
To initialize ObjectJc firstly, its `CTOR_ObjectJc(...)` should be called fistly.
This is done in the following way:

* The public constructor which should only act as instance constructor have not an `ObjectJc*` argument but it may need an argument for the `idObj`, the ident designation. 
It should call `CTOR_ObjectJc(...)` with size and reflection argument  
of the whole instance, from the {cpp} class.


** either in the argument preparation of the base constructor to fullfil its `ObjectJc*` argument, 

 MyClass::MyClass(int idObj) 
 //firstly call the base ctor in C++ syntax:
 : MyBaseClass( CTOR_ObjectJc(&this->base.obj
                , this, sizeof(*this), refl_MyClass, idObj))
 { 
   //...further special init, for this derived data ...
 }

** or, if has not a further {cpp} base class, 
it should call `CTOR_ObjectJc(...)` in the body of the constructor. 

 MyBaseClass::MyBaseClass(int idObj) 
 { CTOR_ObjectJc(&this->base.obj, this, sizeof(*this), refl_MyBaseClass, idObj);
   //...further init, especially call the plain data constructor in C manner:
   ctor_MyPlainData(&this->base.obj);
 }

* A constructor able to use as base constructor should have an argument `ObjectJc* objectJc`.
It should be protected to designate it as base class constructor. 
Or, to simplify it may have a `null` as default value:  

** Either this class has a further {cpp} base class, then it forwards it:

 MyBaseClass::MyBaseClass(ObjectJc const* othiz) 
 : MyBaseBase(othiz)
 { //...further init
 }

** Or it has not a further {cpp} class. Then it should check (assert) whether the given
`othiz` is proper: 

 MyBaseClass::MyBaseClass(ObjectJc const* othiz) 
 { if(othiz == null) { //assumes that this class is the instance class:
     CTOR_ObjectJc(&this->base.obj, this, sizeof(*this), refl_MyBaseClass, idObj);
   } else {
     ASSERT_emC(othiz == &this->base.obj, "C++ ObjectJc initialization error", 0,0);
   }
   //...further init, especially call the plain data constructor in C manner:
   ctor_MyPlainData(&this->base.obj);
 }


[#isInitialized]
=== The isInitialized_ObjectJc(...) state of an object

This is not related to the rest of the chapter above. The operations

* `setInitialized_ObjectJc(ObjectJc* othiz)`
* `isInitialized_ObjectJc(ObjectJc* othiz)`

are related to the instance data, not to the core data of the `ObjectJc` struct. 
The `setInitialized_ObjectJc(ObjectJc* othiz)` should be called if the instance is proper to work.
Then also `isInitialized_ObjectJc(ObjectJc* othiz)` returns true.

Usual software have an '__initialization__' phase after construction. That is used in praxis
but to less mentioned in the ObjectOrientation theory. Basic data should be calculated,
and especially all aggregations should be set.

If an application has aggregations only as a tree (there is a correct order which classes refer which other)
then aggregations can all set only in the constructor. This is the best and maybe theoretical correct case.
It is especially supported for example in Java by using final references. 
But such a system does not allow aggregations between instances one another or circular.
Such is defacto often necessary. 
To succeed theoretical approaches sometimes UML tools handle such situations 
as aggregation only for one direction, and the other direction is an association.
But this is not the desired truth. The aggregations are one another or circular in fact.
They are aggregations because they are never changed in runtime.   

For that the '__initialization__' phase after construction is necessary.
In this phase all aggregations are set of all known and hence constructed instances,
and maybe some values are calculated using the associations, for example derived parameters of controlling. 
If this is done, then the initialization should be ended with `setInitialized_ObjectJc(ObjectJc* othiz)`
for the appropriate instance. For value calculations you may test `isInitialized_ObjectJc(ObjectJc* othiz)`
and get values only from already initialized instances.
Because even the success of initialization may depend on a succeeded initialization of another object,
and the order of initializations cannot be pre-defined, this should be done in a while loop.
If all instances have the data `isInitialized_ObjectJc(ObjectJc* othiz)`,
checked in this while-loop, the while loop for initialization can be left, initialization is finished.

The situation that the successing initialization depends on the succeeded initialization of another instance
and **__vice versa__** is of course a design error. Then the loop is endless. 
It should be checked by a maximum of loops, which is usual less (1..3.. 10) or at maximum the number of instances
if the order of initializing is stupidness exact reverse to the necessary one.   

Not that getting the reference to an instance does not need the succeeded initialization of this instance.
Elsewhere one another or circular aggregations will not be possible. 
But using values for initial calculation of the own values should be gotten only from initialized instances.
For that a tree approach is necessary.

[#alloc]
== ALLOC_ObjectJc()

The macro-wrapped function call of

 ALLOC_ObjectJc(SIZE, REFL, ID)
 
is for C-usage or for creation of non-`class`-data based on `ObjectJc` in C++.
Depending on `DEF_ObjectJc_SIMPLE` it expands either / or to

 allocReflid_ObjectJc(SIZE, ID_##REFL, ID, _thCxt)
 allocRefl_ObjectJc(SIZE, &(REFL), ID, _thCxt)
 
adequate to `CTOR_ObjectJc` in the chapter above. Additionally it requires the 
pointer to a Thread context 
see link:ThCxtExc_emC.html[Stacktrace, ThreadContext and Exception handling]
because generally the allocation can fail, then an Exception handling is recommended.

The core prototype with reflection reference is
 
 extern_C ObjectJc* alloc_ObjectJc ( const int size, const int32 typeInstanceIdent
                 struct ClassJc_T const* refl  , struct ThreadContext_emC_t* _thCxt);

This routine allocates and initializes the core data of the `ObjectJc`.

=== Type check for casting and safety

In classic C programming, sometimes in C++ too, often a pointer is stored and/or transferred as `void*`-pointer if the precise type is not known in the transfer or storing environment. 
Before usage a casting to the required type is done. 
*But such casting turns off the compiler error checking capability.* 
An unchecked cast is a leak for source safety.
A void* pointer should only be used for very general things. For example for `memcpy`.

In {cpp} some casting variants are present. The `static_cast<Type*>(ref)` checks on compile time 
whether the cast is admissible in an inheritance of classes, and adjusts the correct
address value toward the start address of the part inside the instance which is adequate to the given type. If there isn't an inheritance relation between the given type and the cast destination type, it forces a compiler error. But the `static_cast<Type*>` does not check 
the really given instance on runtime. On downcast (toward to a derived class) it assumes that the instance is of this type. A upcast (toward to the base class) is always true.

It means the `static_cast<Type*>(ref)` can cause runtime errors if the assumption of the instance type is false.

The `dynamic_cast<Type*>(ref)` does the same for '_downcast_', but additionally the type is checked. This requires activation of RTTI (__RunTime Type Information__). 
If the type is faulty, either a null pointer is delivered or an Exception is thrown, 
depending on the compiler version. 

The `reinterpret_cast<Type*>(ref)` or a ordinary C-Cast `(Type*)(ref)` delivers faulty results if it is used for inheritance class Types. It is an lackadaisical programming error to use reinterpret or C casts for class inheritance. Such an error is inconspicuous so long as no virtual operations are present. Unchecked or lax usage of C-casts or reinterpret-casts are a prone of error. Because a simple C-cast can be used by accident, a {cpp} compiler emits a warning. To assure compatibility between C and {cpp} a macro `CAST_C(Type, ref)` is defined in `emC/Base/types_def_common.h` which is adapted for {cpp} to a `reinterpret_cast<Type*>`.

In C only the known `(Type*)(ref)` written via macro as `C_CAST(Type*, ref)` is available. The capability of static and dynamic casts are only necessary in respect of class hierarchie in {cpp}. The problem is the same: *Unchecked or lax usage of C-casts or reinterpret-casts are a prone of error.* 

Independently of the question C or {cpp} or with or without RTTI 
the `ObjectJc` base class delivers the type information. 
It works for {cpp} too either using the `ObjectJcpp`-Base class 
or with immediate access to the C data which contains `ObjectJc`.
The type check can be done with

 extern_C ClassJc const refl_MyType;
 .....
 bool bTypeOk = instanceof_ObjectJc((&myDataObj->base.obj, &refl_MyType);
 
This routine recognizes and returns `true` for a base type too if a type information is available using `DEF_REFLECTION_...` not `NO`. The base type is referred in the `ClassJc` instance referred as `reflection` type information.  
See link:Variants_emC.html#refl[Variants of emC-usage in Applications - chapter ClassJc and Reflection].
Note that for class inheritance in {cpp} with multiple inheritance or with virtual operations
a `static_cast<TYPE>(OBJ)` has to be used for cast because addresses should be tuned.
For C inheritance using a base type `struct` as first element of the inherited `struct` 
of course a `C_CAST(TYPE, OBJ)` is only possible and necessary. 

The cast seems to be safe and might not be necessarily be tested if the type is known 
in the user programming environment, because the
same software module stores the instance pointer, and gets it back.
But there may be programming errors, if the algorithm is enhanced etc.etc.
Hence it is recommended to check the type too, but with an *assertion*, 
which can be switched off for fast runtime request. 
With a side glance to Java the type is always checked on runtime for castings.
In Java a casting error is never possible. 
For that the reflection info in `java.lang.Object` is used.
Because castings are not the operations most commonly used in ordinary programs, 
a little bit of calculation time is admissible for that.

The type check only as safety check, as assertion should be written as: 


 ASSERT_emC(INSTANCEOF_ObjectJc((&myData->base.obj, reflection_MyType))
               , "faulty instance", 0, 0);
 MyType* myData = C_CAST(MyType*, myData);
   ...

The assertion `ASSERT_emC(...)` macro is empty if assertions are
not activated, for fast real time execution. If assertions are activated, it causes a THROW, see link:ThCxtExc_emC.html[]. It means the program is continued on the `CATCH` statement in a calling level, not aborted as `assert()` of standard {cp}. 

The `C_CAST` is an `reinterpret_cast` for {cpp} usage 
and a normal `((MyType*) myData)` for C usage. 

The `reflection_MyType` is the type information, see next chapter.

If the type of an instance is really unknown, especially if a base reference is delivered
and the derived type should be a point of interest, the 

 if(INSTANCEOF_ObjectJc&myData->base.obj, reflection_MyType) {
   MyType* myDataderived = static_cast<MyType*>(myDate);
   ...
   
can be a part of the functional code. This example shows a {cpp} class reference
where obj is member on. 

For `DEF_ObjectJc_SIMPLE` whereby `ObjectJc` contains only an int32 value 
only the really instance is able to check. 
If the instance in this example is derived from `MyType` the `INSTANCEOF_ObjectJc(...)` 
returns false though the instance has `MyType` as base class. It is a restriction,
but nevertheless often useful. If at least `DEF_ObjectJc_DEFLREF` is defined and 
the reflection are generated via `DEF_REFLECTION_FULL` all information of base types
are contained there. Then `INSTANCEOF_ObjectJc(...)` returns true also for base classes.
Ot is a question of effort and a question of necessities in the application.

[#podExch]
=== Plain Data exchange

Instances have a 'state'. The 'state' is contained in several elements of the instance. 
It can be the state variable of a state machine, the value of a controller intergral part or such other. 

If there is any complex 'situation' in an application, the analyzes of the state variables can help to explore what was happen. This can be done off line later, after the occurrence and fast fixing the situation. 

It can be helpfully to have a snapshot of the data on time of the situation. Then it is possible to load the snapped data in a simulation of the same software on PC, or a special data exploration software, which contains the same instances but maybe with special relationships. 

* Data from {cpp} classes cannot be copied because it contains virtual pointer etc. 

* Hence it is proper to separate the state data from the rest of the organization data. The state data should be defined in a `struct` which is based on `ObjectJc`.

* In the exploration software the instances can be created and wired (aggregation) on startup. 

* Then the state data are copied into from the snapshot of the data on the occurred situation. If the data contain associations one another, this addresses should be adjusted. 

* To recognize which instance were associated together in the originally snapped data, 
the element `ownAddress` helps. An association (variale connection) is a state, whereby an aggregation or composition (UML) is invariant, not a state. Hence the last one can be part only of the {cpp} class data. Associations may be part of the state data, its addresses should be adjusted with the other memory addresses using the `ownAdress` information.  

* To check whether the data are compatible (version) the `size` and `reflection` helps. It is stupid if the exploration software uses another version as the snapped data from a maybe older device which another, older version.

* The `ObjectJc` contains the head information for the data to correctly support exploration.  


[#refl]
== Reflection and Types

In the full capability of `ObjectJc` reflections contains symbolic information 
for all data elements.
A reflection instance of type `ClassJc` contains the type information, 
all base type information and the fields and maybe operations (methods) too.
With the information about base types (super types) the `instanceof_ObjectJc(...)`
can check whether a given instance is proper for a basic type too. 
The construction of full reflection is described in link:ClassJc_en.html#Header2Refl[ClassJc_en, chapter "The reflection generator"]. 

For simple capability of ObjectJc use-able in embedded platforms 
maybe without String processing with fast realtime or less hardware resources 
there are four variant forms of reflections:

* a) In the simplest form, only an `idType` is stored 
which is contained in the ObjectJc instance too to compare it.
In this case the `ClassJc` is defined as:

 typedef struct ClassJc_t {
  int idType;   // sizeReflOffs;
 } ClassJc;
  
* b) Reflection access with Inspector target proxy. In this case reflection data 
are generated in form of positions of data in a `struct` and a number (index) of any 
`struct` type. In this case the `ClassJc` is defined as:

 typedef struct ClassJc_t {
  int idType;   // sizeReflOffs;
  //
  int const* reflOffs;
 } ClassJc;
  
* c) The reference `reflOffs` refers to the generated reflection data. 
As the reflection data are defined in succession in a "const" memory area,
the low 16-bit of this pointer address can be used as a type identifier.

* d) No Reflection access, `DEF_REFLECTION_NO` is set: 
The reflections are only defined to have information about the type:

 typedef struct ClassJc_t {
  int idType;   // sizeReflOffs;
  //
  char const* nameType;
 } ClassJc;
 
The `nameType` is optional depending on `DEF_NO_StringJcCapabilities`. 
See `org/vishia/emC/sourceApplSpecific/SimpleNumCNoExc/ObjectJc_simple.h` 

The kind to build the `idType` depends on some possibilities on initialization
of the `reflection_...Type` instance and can be defined by the users programming. 
For example additional information, which can be used for debugging, are given outside
a fast realtime and low resource CPU, the `idType` is a simple index. 
It is important that the `idType` of all reflection instances are unique.
The `instanceof_ObjectJc(...)` compares only the `idType` given with the `reflection...`
argument with the type information in `ObjectJc`. It is the low 16 bit 
of `idInstanceType` for the simple `ObjectJc`.  

For the reflection with full capability see link:ClassJc_en.html[]. 

[#variantCapab]
== Using of the sources for ObjectJc variants in Projects

If the emC approach should be used also in less and new projects. Firstly it may be recommended to use only a subset, not all possibilities. It is too much for starting. For example the reflection approach may be a novelty, which shouldn't  impose on a new user. Hence, the simple form of ObjectJc (see link:#ObjectJc[chapter What is ObjectJc]) can be used firstly. It is defined in the header and source files `emC/Base/ObjectSimple_emC.*`

For complete usage of the capabilities of `ObjectJc` the files `emC/Base/ObjectRefl_emC.*` can be used.

Only for usage the full capability of Java-like approaches the `emC/Jc/ObjectJc.*` offers more possibilities.


[#inclObjectJc]
=== Object_emC.h includes the correct one

You should set the usage decision in `applstdef_emC.h` which is able to include in your path:

 #include <applstdef_emC.h>
 
An include of

 #include <emC/Base/Object_emC.h>
 
includes the correct one file:

----
/**Include Object_emC in the proper way: */
#if defined(DEF_ObjectSimple_emC)
  #include <emC/Base/ObjectSimple_emC.h>
#else 
  #define DEF_ObjectJc_FULLCAPABILITY   //to compile content of ObjectRefl_emC.c
  #include <emC/Base/ObjectRefl_emC.h>
#endif
----

It means for the simple case only the `Object_emC.h` and `ObjectSimple_emC.h` should be present with the `ObjectSimple_emC.c` including as source. If `ObjectRefl_emC.h` is used, it needs `ObjectRefl_emC.c` and some more files which's capabilities are declared.
 
 
But of course with `DEF_ObjectSimple_emC` the capability of `DEF_REFLECTION_FULL` and some other stuff cannot be used. 

[#ObjectJc_c]
=== Which sources

Refer to the test environment. The test is done for all variants. 

...TODO in test cases decide between DEF_ObjectSimple_emC to use different file sets.
