== Principle of virtual call

It is an interface, only define operations, without implementation.

 class IfcCvirt {
  public: virtual void doFirst ( float val )=0;
  public: virtual void doOther ( float val )=0;
  public: virtual void doAny ( int val1, int val2 )=0;
 }; 

It is one from more implementation classes:

 class ImplAvirt : public IfcCvirt { 
   private: int i1, i2; float f1;  //any data
   
   public: virtual void doFirst ( float val );
   public: void doOther ( float val );
   public: void doAny ( int val1, int val2 );
   public: virtual char const* doAnywhat();
 };
 
The `doFirst` can be overridden again, a new doAnywhat has an implementation, 
but can be overridden in an derived class.   

A further inheritance overrides both operations and stops ability to override `doFirst`:

 class ImplBvirt : public ImpBvirt { 
   public: void doFirst ( float val );
   public: virtual char const* doAnywhat();
 };
 
The implementations of the operations are done in the cpp file. 

The invocation of a virtual call is written in C:

 void testVtbl_virtual (  IfcCvirt* ifc ) {
  ifc->doFirst(2.25f);
 }
 
The machine code for this routine for a Texas Instruments processor TMS320C28000
compiled with the "TI composer studio" looks like:

 0000002b       _testVtbl_virtual__FP8IfcCvirt:
 0000002b 0204          MOVB      ACC,#4               
 0000002c 07C4          ADDL      ACC,*+XAR4[0]        
 0000002d 83A9          MOVL      XAR5,ACC             
 0000002e E802          MOVIZ     R0H,#16400           
 0000002f 0080 
 00000030 3B01          SETC      SXM                  
 00000031 A8A9          MOVL      ACC,XAR4             
 00000032 C5D5          MOVL      XAR7,*+XAR5[2]       
 00000033 81C5          ADD       ACC,*+XAR5[0]        
 00000034 8AA9          MOVL      XAR4,ACC             
 00000035 3E67          LCR       *XAR7                
                      ; call occurs [XAR7] ; [] |20|  

The last machine instruction is `LCR`, a _Long Call_ which uses register `XAR7` 
containing the calling address. The variable `ifc` comes into with the register `XAR4`.
It refers anywhere in the RAM area. In line `002c` the RAM is accessed, `XAR5` contains
the reference to the vtbl after that. In line `0032` the start address of the 
called routine is read from the vtbl. 

== Possible errors

The vtbl is located in the ROM area or inside
any protected area in Memory, because it is program space. Hence the start addresss
in the vtbl is safe. But the reference to the vtbl in `XAR5`, read from a RAM location,
can be faulty. If there are no software errors, it is safe. But any not found error
in any software module can overwrite any location in the RAM. Then the reference to the
vtbl is faulty, any other location is addressed, and any desired start address is read
and called. The probability of such an error is less. But the impact may be hard.

If such an error occurs on a PC application, usual an unexpected memory access exception 
may occur, and an exception handling rescues the situation. The functionality may be 
disturbed, the PC application may be restart. 

But such an error on an embedded platform maybe in safety critical environments may be
non acceptable. 

The problem is: The pointer to the vtbl is placed inside data, and the access is not checked.

== Solution: An explicit virtual table with check

A solution of the non-safety problem is: The same mechanism which is used internally
in C++ is implemented as *explicit mechanism*. There are two advantages:

* The sensitive reference to the vtbl can be checked.
* If more as one operations are called with the same vtbl, the refence should be gotten
from data only one time, it is faster.

But of course, it is important that this reference should not be disturbed in the same way.
If the reference is hold in stack variables while an operation runs, the stack area
may be seen as more safe than any data area. Because: The stack contains return addresses
which are sensitive in the same kind. If the stack area is unsafe against software errors,
the whole application may be unsafe. But the data area is large, can be accessed by
other threads or processes, because in Embedded Target systems a memory protection
is often not present.

The disadvantage of the solution is:

* Additional program effort.

An effort can be a source of errors, it may be erroneous programmed. 
Hence an automatic code generation for that parts can be aimed. 

=== Definition of an explicit vtbl for an interface

The basics for the vtbl are function pointer. There are available in C syntax. 
C++ function pointer can present only uniform operations in the same class, 
it cannot be used here.

 /**Firstly we need C-FunctionType-Prototypes. 
  * Note: the typedef is syntactically more clear than (*Oper_doit...)
  */
 typedef void Oper_doitFloat_Base_ifc(class IfcExpl* thiz, float val);
 typedef void Oper_doitInt2_Base_ifc(class IfcExpl* thiz,  int val1, int val2);
 
The next one is a significance string to check:

 #define sign_Vtbl_IfcExpl "sign_Vtbl_IfcExpl_MyAppl"
 
Now a vtbl struct for this interface can be defined:

 /**This is the explicitely virtual table of the interface. 
  * Its content is adequate the vtbl internally in C++
  * if virtual operations are defined.*/ 
 typedef struct Vtbl_IfcExpl_T {
  char const* sign;
  Oper_doitFloat_IfcExpl* doFirst;
  Oper_doitFloat_IfcExpl* doOther;
  Oper_doitInt2_IfcExpl* doAny;
 } Vtbl_IfcExpl_s;

It is similar as the automatic created vtbl from the C++ compiler. Additionally 
it has the `sign` member.  

=== An interface class with this vtbl struct type
 
The interface C++ class does not define any operations, because it does not implement
one, it contains only the explicit const reference to the vtbl and a constuctor:

 /**This class is used as interface reference, without implememtation. 
  * It has only a protected ctor, cannot instantiate.
  */
 class IfcExpl {
  /**The IfcExpl has not virtual operations, 
   * but the explicit reference to the vtbl. */
  public: Vtbl_IfcExpl_s const* const vtbl_IfcExpl;
  /**An explicit ctor is necessary: */
  protected: IfcExpl ( struct Vtbl_IfcExpl_T const* const);
 };
 
The interface class is not able to instantiate, it should not be instantiate. 

The ctor is written as:

 IfcExpl::IfcExpl ( Vtbl_IfcExpl_s const* const vtbl)
 : vtbl_IfcExpl(vtbl)
 {}



=== An implementing class for the interface

The following class should implement all operations of the interface. It is defined as:

 class ImplA : public IfcExpl {
  protected: Vtbl_ImplA_s const* const vtbl_ImplA;
  protected: int i1, i2; float f;
  public: ImplA ( );
  protected: ImplA ( Vtbl_ImplA_s const* vtblA);
  /**Defines the implementation of the interface-operations.
   * The identifier do not need identically, but it is strongly recommended. */
  public: void doFirst ( float val);
  public: void doOther ( float val);
  public: void doAny ( int val1, int val2);
  public: float getVal ( ){ return this->f; } 
 };

In this example the implementing class supports further override of its operations.
Hence it has a own vtbl too. This is a complex example. For a simple interface
implementation this `vtbl_ImplA` is not necessary.

The implementing operations are defined in the class as normal operations, without `virtual```.

=== How to define the vtbl instance for ImplA

The vtbl should be defined for the implementation in `ImplA`. Because the referenced
operations are C-functions, they should be defined in the cpp file:

 /**********************************************************************/
 /*Implementation for the explicit vtbl wraps the C++ operations in C  */

 static void doFirst_ImplA ( IfcExpl* thizi, float val) {
  ImplA* thiz = static_cast<ImplA*>(thizi);
  thiz->doFirst(val);  //calls routine from ImplementorA
 }

 static void doOther_ImplA ( IfcExpl* thizi, float val) {
  (static_cast<ImplA*>(thizi))->doOther(val);  //calls routine from ImplementorA
 }
 
The principle is shown only for two operations. The second one is more simple, 
the first one defines explicitely the casted reference from the base ifcExpl 
reference type to the implementation type. 
This casting is done on C++ implicit virtual call implicit in an adequate way. 
The `static_cast<..>(..)` tunes the address value of the reference. It is done in the 
TI listing in chapter above with the `ADD ACC,*+XAR5[0]` - statement on `0033`. 
The offset for the `thiz` address is stored in `[0]` of the vtbl.

With the C-wrapper the vtbl is defined:

 //The definition of the vtbl for ImplA, written to const memory area (!)
 static Vtbl_ImplA_s const vtbl_ImplA_Def =
 { sign_Vtbl_ImplA
 , doFirst_ImplA
 , doAnywhat
 , { sign_Vtbl_IfcExpl
   , doFirst_ImplA
   , doOther_ImplA
   , doAny_ImplA
  }
 };

Because of the `class ImplA` has its own vtbl definition, the vtbl for the `ifcExpl`
is part of them, it is a nested struct.  
  
The vtbl definition is located in the const memory area which can be mapped to the ROM
space, because it is a pure `const` definition. It is adequate as the implicit vtbl
generated from the C++ compiler. The vtbl contains the start addresses of the 
C wrapper functions, and the pointer to the sign string.

=== ctor, const vtbl initialization in the class instances

The public ctor of ImplA looks like:

 ImplA::ImplA ( )
  : IfcExpl(&vtbl_ImplA_Def.IfcExpl)
  , vtbl_ImplA(&vtbl_ImplA_Def)
 { }

It initializes the IfcExpl base class (ctor in chapter above) with the proper part
of the `vtbl_ImplA_Def` ( it is a const reference). The own const reference to the vtbl
is initialized in the intializer list of the ctor adequate. It produces a similar
memory layout as in C++ implicit generated code for virtual operations.


=== Using the explicit vtbl

This is the important part. All stuff above do the adequate things like a C++ compiler 
for virtual operations.

 void test_TestVtblExplicit ( ) {
  TEST_START("TestVtblExplicit");
  ImplA* implA = new ImplA();
  IfcExpl* ifcA = implA;  //automatic static cast
  
  //vtbl as stack-local variable, 
  //secured because stack area should be secure anycase
  Vtbl_IfcExpl_s const* const vtblA = ifcA->vtbl_IfcExpl;
  if(ASSERT_emC(strcmp(vtblA->sign, sign_Vtbl_IfcExpl)==0, "check implA", 0,0)) {
    vtblA->doFirst(ifcA, 2.25f);
    //... some more usage of vtblA in this thread
  }

This is a part of the test routine in sources 

 Test_emC/src/test/cpp/emC_Test_C_Cpp/TestVtblExplicit.cpp

This code should be part of the user. The `ifcA` is a given interface-type-reference 
to any implementing instance. The implementing instance is unknown from this focus.

Accessing `ifcA->vtbl_IfcExmpl` gets the vtbl-refernce in an explicit pointer variable.
This variable should never be stored in any common data location. It is a register variable
or it is in stack area. 

The `strcmp` operation evaluates the string comparison of the `sign` 
inside the vtbl with the given string literal. If the comparison is true, the vtbl
references exactly this string. The same string in any other meaning should not be 
present in memory. All references to this string identifies the vtbl as correct. 

Note that instead a string compare only the comparison of the reference to the string
may be satisfy, if the string literal is stored only one in memory. This `strcmp` is
necessary if different independent compilation units are used (for dll, for example
in S-functions in Simulink (Mathworks (R)), that code should be able to use in such 
environments too.

The `ASSERT_emC` causes a throw if Exception handling is present. Without exception handling
only the defective usage of the vtblA is prevented, but the occurrence of that error
can be written in a log area inside the Embedded Device. Hence a functionality
does not work because of a malign and unexpected data error, but the processing
of machine instructions are not disturbed. It is not a crash. 

The follwing line does the same as a virtual call in C++, without check, with possible crash:

  //This is just as well unsafe as C++ virtual call:
  ifcB->vtbl_IfcExpl->doFirst(ifcB, 2.25f);

The example, inclusively the more complex further derivation and implementation of 
explicit virtual operations, can be download and tested via

You can clone or copy *Test_emC*, inside the build the *src_emC* is cloned. This is a
more complex collection of sources able to use for Embedded Control and especially
test of sources for embedded PC-based. The vtbl topic is only a minor fact for that. 
The sources and tests of *emC* are improved in this time (april, may 2020).
