== Approach

An average value is the sum of some values divided with the number of values.
That is familiar.
In Mathematics it is either a determined integral:

stem:[sqrt(4) = 2]

[asciimath]
++++
sqrt(4) = 2
++++

[latexmath]
++++
\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}
+ \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}
+ r S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}
- r V = 0
++++
