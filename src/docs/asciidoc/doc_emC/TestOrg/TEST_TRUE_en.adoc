== Test environment, mock, dependency injection

(additonal content with common meaning, TODO)

The test routines itself calls one or some routines from the module sources 
in an environment arranged in the respective test routine. If instances are necessary,
they are created and removed after test in the test routine. If additional depending
complex modules are necessary, they should be replaces by mock objects because elsewhere
the other module is tested too in a complex non-independent kind. The mock object
should be simple and can contain some helper for checking the test behavior. 
The possible usage of dependency injection instead instantiating of composite objects
inside the test object is a problem of the module source, not a problem of the test itself.
